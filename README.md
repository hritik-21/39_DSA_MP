Call Center Simulator 📞A simple desktop application built with Java Swing that simulates a call center's waiting line. This project was created as a mini-project for a Data Structures and Algorithms course to demonstrate a practical, real-world application of the Queue data structure.The simulator manages incoming customer calls based on the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, ensuring the first caller to wait is the first to be helped.[!NOTE]Insert a screenshot of the application here!(A great README has a screenshot. Just drag and drop your final CallCenterGUI.png into this file after you create it on GitHub).🎯 Core Concepts DemonstratedData Structure: QueueImplementation: java.util.LinkedListWhy: The Queue is the perfect data structure for this problem, providing constant-time $O(1)$ complexity for both adding (enqueuing) and removing (dequeuing) elements. This is far more efficient than an ArrayList, which has an $O(n)$ complexity for removing from the front.Algorithm: FIFO (First-In, First-Out)Why: This is the core logic of any fair waiting line. The simulator strictly enforces that the first call to be added to the queue is the first one to be processed.✨ FeaturesModern UI: Uses the third-party FlatLaf (Light) library for a clean, modern, and responsive user interface (a significant improvement over the default Java Swing look).Add Calls: A simple form to enter a caller's name and their issue.Process Calls: A "Process Next Call" button that removes the call from the front of the queue (FIFO) and displays its details in a pop-up.Real-time Queue Display: A scrollable text area that updates instantly, showing all calls currently waiting in the queue, in order.Clear Queue: A button to clear all waiting calls from the queue (with a confirmation dialog).Demo Data: Pre-loads the queue with sample data on startup for immediate demonstration.🛠️ Technology StackLanguage: Java (JDK 8+)Core Data Structure: java.util.Queue (implemented with java.util.LinkedList)GUI: javax.swing (Java Swing)GUI Theme: FlatLaf (for the modern look and feel)🚀 Getting StartedTo run this project locally, you'll need Java (JDK 8 or higher) and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
2. Add the FlatLaf Library (Crucial!)This project requires the FlatLaf library (.jar file) to run, as it controls the GUI theme.Download: Go to the FlatLaf GitHub releases page and download the latest flatlaf-x.x.jar file (e.g., flatlaf-3.4.1.jar).Add to your IDE:In IntelliJ IDEA:Go to File > Project Structure... (or press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S).Select Libraries from the left-hand menu.Click the + (Add) button and select Java.Navigate to and select the flatlaf-x.x.jar file you just downloaded.Click OK to apply the changes.3. Run the ApplicationOnce the library is added, you can run the project:Locate the CallCenterGUI.java file.Right-click it and select "Run 'CallCenterGUI.main()'".📋 How to UseLaunch the application. The queue display will show the pre-loaded demo calls.To add a new call, type a Name and Issue in the top panel and click "Add Call to Queue".Observe the new call appearing at the bottom of the queue display.To process a call, click "Process Next Call". A pop-up will show the details of the call from the top of the list.The queue display will update, showing the processed call has been removed.Click "Clear All Calls" to empty the queue.
